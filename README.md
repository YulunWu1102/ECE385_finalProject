This git repo is for final Project of ECE 385. The project is a FPGA based “Tank-Stars” game that allows 2 players to participate the game. The play can choose their tank with different property, and they will shoot cannon ball to each other in order to win the game. With (W/A/S/D) and (I/J/K/L), two players can control the movement of their tanks, and with (V/Space) and (P/Enter), they can reload and shoot cannonball to each other. To run the program, the user needs to first compile the code on the workspace, than use "programmer" in quartus to implement the code in FPGA. Then, the user needs to open NIOS-II programmer (Eclipse for our project), and run the C code. Then the program will write the background picture and run USB communication, and then you are good to go!
